# odin-recipes

This is a simple website that I programmed in HTML and CSS that shows a list of recipes. Clicking on any recipe will take you to another page that displays an image, description, ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions on the recipe selected. To view the website click on the link in the 'About' section.
