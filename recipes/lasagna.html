    <p><h2><em>Step-by-Step Instructions</em></h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a 
            Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, 
            and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, 
            basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, 
            and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 
            2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of 
            a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat 
            sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 
            1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce 
            over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan 
            cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil 
            with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and 
            bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
